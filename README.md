# XamlQuery
The write less, do more XAML library for WPF, Xamarin and Silverlight.

What is XamlQuery

XamlQuery is a lightweight yet powerful library that enables rapid web development in Silverlight. It simplifies several tasks like page/document traversing; finding controls by name, type, style, property value or position in control tree; event handling; animating and much more. In short, what XamlQuery aims to do to Silverlight is similar to what jQuery does to JavaScript.

XamlQuery provides two approaches for finding controls.
  Using Selector Queries, and
  Using Managed Helper Methods
